#### Location
```haskell
type Location 
 = { left : Float
   , top : Float
   }
```

##### loc
```haskell
loc : (Float, Float) -> Location
loc (left, top) = {left = left, top = top}   
```

#### Renderable

A Renderable contains a form to be rendered and a location where
it should be rendered.
```haskell
type Renderable =
  {
    element : Form
  , location : Location
 } 
```

##### render
```haskell
render : Int -> Int -> [Renderable] -> Element
```

  Given a width, height, and list of Renderables, generates an Element with
  each Renderable within it. The first elements will be displayed beneath the
  last elements.


#### Animation

  An Animation has a start and end state and a duration for
  how long it should take to transform between the two states.

  The animate operation takes in a starting time and an Renderable
  and produces a time varying renderable.

```haskell
type Animation a
 = { start : a
   , end : a
   , duration : Time
   , animate : Time -> Renderable -> (Time -> Renderable) 
   }
```

##### compose
```haskell
compose : Animation a -> Animation a -> Animation a
```

Composes two animations together such that the first animation
occurs followed immediately by the second animation.

##### composeMany
```haskell
composeMany : [Animation a] -> Animation a
```

Composes many animations together from left to right.

#### MoveAnimation
```haskell
type MoveAnimation = Animation Location
```

##### move
```haskell
move : Location -> Location -> Time -> MoveAnimation
```
  Constructs a MoveAnimation from the first location to the
  second location at a constant speed over the specified duration.

##### moveMany
```haskell
moveMany : [Location] -> Time -> MoveAnimation
```
  Constructs a MoveAnimation along a path generated by the provided locations
  the speed is constant over the specified duration

##### ease
```haskell
ease : EasingFunction -> Animation a -> Animation a
```
  Given an Animation, changes the speed of the animation using the specified
  EasingFunction.

##### EasingFunction
```haskell
{-|     
  An EasingFunction takes in the percentage [0,1] of time that has passed and
  returns the percentage of travel that has been completed.
 -}
type EasingFunction = Float -> Float
```

##### makeEasing
```haskell
makeEasing : (Float, Float) -> (Float -> Float) -> EasingFunction
```
  Given a lower and upper bound for input time and a function, 
  creates an easing function
  where time specified outside the range is treated as either a 0 or 1.

```haskell
linear : EasingFunction
linear = makeEasing (0, 1) id

sine : EasingFunction
sine = makeEasing (0, 1) (\t -> (sin((t*pi)-(pi/2))+1)/2)
```
